# Password generator

### This is a basic password generator app.

Passwords generated through this app will include the criteria below:

- Will be between 8 and 128 characters

- Will contain special characters

- Will contain numeric characters

- Will contain lowercase characters

- Will contain uppercase characters

--

Tasks:

- How do I keep the password from expanding in length with each confirmation? (maybe divide "passlength" with number of confirmations? What happens if division results in remainder such that password length is shorter than user requested?) 

- Try adding entire special list (backslash value is being ignored)

Questions:

- How do I assign a value to the text area? 

- How do I shuffle characters?
